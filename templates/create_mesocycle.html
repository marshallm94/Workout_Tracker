<h1>Create a Mesocycle</h1>

	<p>
	Different exercises in a split will likely follow different<br>
	periodization models over the course of a mesocycle. <br>
	The approach this application takes is to create the <br>
	microcycle/split first, <b>without assigning</b> <br>
	<b>sets/reps/RPE/RIR to any movement</b>, and then go through <br>
	that microcycle and apply a periodization strategy to each <br>
	movement individually. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Note that this application does <b>NOT</b> keep track of off days <br>
	(i.e. if your microcycle lasts one calendar week but you only <br>
	train 4 days out of that week, the split you create should be a 4 <br>
	day microcycle). With that in mind, how many workouts will there <br>
	be in your microcycle?
